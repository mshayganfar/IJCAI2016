We have investigated the mutual influence of affective and collaborative
processes in a cognitive theory to support interaction between humans and robots
or virtual agents. We have developed new algorithms for appraisal processes, as
part of a new overall computational model for implementing collaborative robots
and agents. We build primarily on the \textit{cognitive appraisal} theory of
emotions and the \textit{SharedPlans} theory of collaboration to investigate the
structure, fundamental processes and functions of emotions in a collaboration.
We have evaluated our implemented algorithms by conducting an online user study.

\section{Introduction}
\vspace*{-1mm}
% Sousa in The Rationality of Emotion \cite{sousa:rationality-emotion}
% makes the case for claiming that humans are capable of rationality largely
% because they are creatures with emotions. 
The idea of having robots or other intelligent agents living in a human
environment has been a persistent dream from science fiction books to artificial
intelligence and robotics laboratories. Collaborative robots are expected to
become an integral part of humans' environment to accomplish their industrial
and household tasks. In these environments humans will be involved in robots'
operations and decision-making processes. The involvement of humans influences
the efficiency of robots' interaction and performance, and makes them dependent
on humans' cognitive abilities and mental states.

This work is implemented as part of a larger effort to build robots capable of
generating and recognizing emotions in order to be better collaborators. In this
paper, we report on the specific problem of appraising the relevance and
controllability of events within a collaborative interaction. Our contribution
is to ground general appraisal concepts in the specific context and structure of
collaboration. This work is part of the development of \textit{Affective
Motivational Collaboration Theory} which is built on the foundations of the
\textit{SharedPlans} theory of collaboration \cite{grosz:plans-discourse} and
the \textit{cognitive appraisal} theory of emotions
\cite{gratch:domain-independent}.

There are several appraisal models contributing in different applications such
as robotics, virtual agents and social sciences. However, none of these models
have focused on the appraisal processes during collaboration. We believe
appraisal plays a key role in collaboration due to its regulatory and evaluative
nature. Also, collaboration induces some differences to underlying appraisal
processes due to its unique nature. For instance, although the major appraisal
models use utility to compute the relevance of an event, we have found new
cognitive components involved in determining utility because of the influence of
the collaboration. These components, such as recurrence of a belief by the human
collaborator or influence of the human collaborator's peceived emotion on the 
robot's decisions emphasize the fact that collaboration creates demands for
different procedures in appraisal processes. In this paper, we provide the
relevance and controllability appraisals of an event within the collaboration
context.

% After discussing related works, we briefly introduce the Affective Motivational
% Collaboration Theory, focusing on the collaboration and appraisal mechanisms as
% well as mental states. We then provide more details about the graph
% representation of the robot's mental state. Next, we describe the algorithms we
% developed to compute the value of four crucial appraisal variables. To compare
% the results from our algorithms with humans' decisions we have conducted a user
% study using crowd sourcing; the results are provided in Section
% \ref{sec:user-study}.

\vspace*{-2mm}
\section{Related Work}
\vspace*{-1mm}
Our work builds on the general notions of appraisal theory
\cite{gratch:domain-independent,marsella:computational,scherer:sequential-appraisal-process,scherer:appraisal-processes},
but is focused on its application in human-robot collaboration. Computational
appraisal models have been applied to a variety of uses including psychology,
robotics, AI, and cognitive science. For instance, in
\cite{marsella:ema-process-model} EMA is used to generate specific predictions
about how human subjects will appraise and cope with emotional situations.
Furthermore, appraisal theory has been used in robots' decision making
\cite{castro:autonomous-robot-fear}, or in their cognitive systems
\cite{hudlicka:emotinos-reasons,marinier:emotion-reinforcement}. Additionally,
in the virtual agents community, empathy and affective decision-making is a
research topic that has received much attention in the last two decades
\cite{scott:modeling-empathy-agent,paiva:agent-care,pontier:women-robot-men,velasquez:emotions-motivations-agents}.
However, EMA and several other examples in artificial intelligence and robotics
which apply appraisal theory do not focus on the dynamics of collaborative
contexts
\cite{adam:bdi-emotional-companion,kim:model-hri-appraisal,marsella:ema-process-model,rosenbloom:sigma-appraisal}.

The computational collaboration model in our work is strongly influenced by the
SharedPlans theory \cite{grosz:plans-discourse}. However, our algorithms are
also compatible with other collaboration theories, e.g., Joint Intentions theory
\cite{cohen:teamwork}, or STEAM \cite{tambe:flexible-teamwork}. These theories
have been extensively used to examine and describe teamwork and collaboration.
Yet, collaboration and emotion theories have never been combined, as they are in
our work. We believe a systematic integration of collaboration theories and
appraisal theory can help describe the underlying collaboration processes
leading to the existing collaboration structures.

\section{{\fontsize{11.85}{12}\selectfont Affective Motivational Collaboration
Theory}}

Affective Motivational Collaboration Theory deals with the interpretation and
prediction of observable behaviors in a dyadic collaboration
\cite{shayganfar:appraisal-short}. The theory focuses on the processes regulated
by emotional states. The observable behaviors represent the outcome of reactive
and deliberative processes related to the interpretation of the self's
relationship to the environment. Affective Motivational Collaboration Theory
aims to explain both rapid emotional reactions to events as well as slower, more
deliberative responses. The reactive and deliberative processes are triggered by
two types of events: \textit{external} events, such as the other's
\textit{utterances} and \textit{primitive actions}, and \textit{internal}
events, comprising changes in the self's mental states, such as belief formation
and emotional changes. The theory explains how emotions regulate the underlying
processes when these events occur. It also elucidates the role of
\textit{motives} as goal-driven emotion-regulated constructs with which a robot
can form new intentions to cope with events.

  Affective Motivational Collaboration Theory (arrows indicate primary
  influences between mechanisms).}}
  \vspace*{-3mm}
  \label{fig:cpm}
\end{figure}

Our focus is on the mechanisms depicted as mental processes in Figure
\ref{fig:cpm} along with the mental states. Each mechanism includes one or
more processes in our architecture. For instance, the \textit{Collaboration}
mechanism includes processes such as \textit{Focus Shifting} and
\textit{Constraint Management}, while as we discuss in Section
\ref{sec:appraisal-process} the \textit{Appraisal} mechanism includes processes
to compute the values for different appraisal variables. The \textit{mental
states} includes self's (robot's) beliefs, intentions, motives, goals and
emotion instances as well as the anticipated mental states of the other (human).
The \textit{Collaboration} mechanism maintains constraints on actions, including
task states and the ordering of tasks, and provides processes to update and
monitor the shared plan. The \textit{Appraisal} mechanism is responsible for
evaluating changes in the self's mental states, the anticipated mental states of
the other, and the state of the collaboration environment. The \textit{Coping}
mechanism provides the self with different coping strategies associated with
changes in the self's mental states with respect to the state of the
collaboration. The \textit{Motivation} mechanism operates whenever the self a)
requires a new motive to overcome an internal impasse in an ongoing task, or b)
wants to provide an external motive to the other when the other faces a problem
in a task. The \textit{Theory of Mind} mechanism infers a model of the other's
anticipated mental state. The self progressively updates this model during the
collaboration.

\vspace*{-2mm}
\subsection{Mental States}
\label{sec:mental-states}
\vspace*{-2mm}
A brief description of mental states is provided as prerequisite knowledge for
understanding the appraisal processes. The mental states shown in Figure
\ref{fig:cpm} comprise the knowledge base required for all the mechanisms in the
overall model. Mental states are conscious states of mind providing the content
for cognitive processes. These mental states possess attributes, each of which
provides a unique interpretation of the related cognitive entities. The self
uses these attributes whenever there is an arbitration in the internal cognitive
processes. We only describe some of the attributes of beliefs and motives in
this paper, since they are used in our appraisal algorithms.

\textit{Beliefs} are a crucial part of the mental states. Beliefs have
attributes and they impact different processes of the framework such as the
evaluation of an external event by the Appraisal mechanism, and updates to the
collaboration plan. We use three belief attributes in the Appraisal mechanism.
Belief \textit{strength} is about how strongly the self holds salient beliefs
about an object, an entity, or an anticipated behavior. The \textit{saliency} of
a belief is a cognitive attribute that pertains to how easily the self becomes
aware of a belief. The \textit{persistence} of a belief refers to how resistant
the belief is to changes.

\textit{Motives} are mental constructs which can initiate, direct and maintain
goal-directed behaviors. They are created by the emotion-regulated Motivation
mechanism. Motives can cause the formation of a new intention for the robot
according to: a) its own emotional states, b) its own private goal, c) the
collaboration (shared) goal, and d) other's anticipated beliefs. Motives possess
a set of attributes. The Motivation mechanism compares motives based on the
quality of these attributes and chooses the one which is the most related to the
current state of the collaboration. We use two motive attributes in Appraisal
mechanisms. The \textit{importance} of a motive is determined by the
corresponding beliefs about the effects of achieving or not achieving the
associated goal. The \textit{urgency} of a motive defines how much time the self
has to acknowledge and address that motive before it is too late.

\textit{Intentions} are mental constructs directed at goals and future actions.
They play an essential role in taking actions according to the collaboration
plan as well as behavior selection in the Coping mechanism. Intentions are
also involved in selecting intention-related strategies, e.g., planning, seeking
instrumental support and procrastination. 

% Intentions possess a set of
% attributes, i.e., \textit{Temporal Status, Direct Experience, Certainty,
% Ambivalence, Affective-Deliberative Consistency} which moderate the consistency
% between intention and behavior \cite{cooke:intention-behavior-consistency}. The
% details about these attributes are beyond the scope of this paper.

\textit{Goals} help the robot to create and update its collaboration plan
according to the current private and shared goal content and structure. Goals
direct the formation of intentions to take appropriate corresponding actions
during collaboration. 

% Goals also drive the Motivation mechanism to generate
% required motive(s). The details about goal's attributes are beyond the scope of
% this paper.

\textit{Emotions} in mental states are emotion instances that are elicited by
the Appraisal mechanism, e.g., \textit{Joy, Anger, Hope, Worry}. These emotion
instances include the robot's own emotions as well as the anticipated emotions
of the other which are created with the help of the processes in the Theory of
Mind mechanism. 

% Each emotion has its own functionality in either the
% intrapersonal or interpersonal level. These emotions not only regulate the
% self's internal processes, but also assist the self to anticipate the other's
% mental states.

\end{figure*}

% \section{Example Scenario}
% 
% The example scenario is part of a much larger interaction we are implementing to
% test our theory. This example shows a very short part of an interaction between
% a robot and an astronaut during their collaboration. Their mission is to finish
% installing a few solar panels together. However, the astronaut encounters a
% measurement tool problem:
% 
% \begin{description}
%   \item \textit{\textbf{\fontsize{9pt}{12pt}\selectfont Astronaut [turn t-1]:}}
%   Oh no! Finishing the quality check of our installation with this measurement
%   problem is so frustrating. I think we should stop now!
% 
%   \item \textit{\textbf{\fontsize{9pt}{12pt}\selectfont{Robot [turn t]:}}}
%   I see. This is frustrating. But, I can help you with the measurement tool and
%   we can finish the task as originally planned.
% \end{description}
% 
% \vspace*{-1mm}
% In this scenario, the robot appraises the problem with the measurement tool as
% a \textit{relevant, undesirable, unexpected}, but \textit{controllable} event.
% Consequently, the coping mechanism first acknowledges the astronaut's negative
% valenced emotion (i.e., frustration), then provides a new plan to continue the
% collaboration.

\vspace*{-3mm}
\section{Collaboration}
\label{sec:collaboration}

The Collaboration mechanism constructs a hierarchy of goals associated with
tasks in a hierarchical task network (see Figure \ref{fig:taskModel}), and also
maintains the constraints and other required details of the collaboration
including the inputs and outputs of individual tasks, the \textit{preconditions}
(specifying whether it is appropriate to perform a task), and the
\textit{postconditions} (specifying whether a just-completed task was
successful). Collaboration also monitors the focus of attention, which
determines the salient objects, properties and relations at each point, and
shifts the focus of attention during the interaction.

%   \caption{{\fontsize{9}{9}\selectfont Collaboration structure (shared plan).}}
%   \label{fig:cs}
%   \vspace*{-2mm}
% \end{figure}

Here, we describe the methods which retrieve information about the collaboration
structure, and are used to compute the values of appraisal variables. In these
methods, $\varepsilon_t$ is the event corresponding to time \textit{t}, and
$g_t$ is a given goal at time \textit{t}.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2pt]
  \setlength\itemsep{0.2mm}
  \item \textit{recognizeGoal($\varepsilon_t$)} returns the unique goal to which
  the given event (action, utterance, or emotional expression) directly
  contributes; it is only one goal since the robot can only do one primitive
  action at a time in our collaboration model. However, in the goal tree, a
  given primitive action can contribute to more than one higher level (parent)
  goal. The method returns \textit{ambiguous} if it does not recognize a goal in
  the plan.
  
%   \item \textit{topLevelGoalStatus($g_t$)} returns the status of the top level
%   goal whether it is \textsc{achieved, failed, blocked, inapplicable, pending,}
%   or \textsc{in progress}. In our example, ``Prepare Two Sandwiches'' is the top
%   level goal.
  
  \item \textit{currGoalStatus($g_t$)} returns whether the current goal status 
  is \textsc{achieved, failed, blocked, inapplicable, pending,} or \textsc{in
  progress}. In our example, ``Add Pickles'' is the current
  (focused) goal.
  
  \item \textit{precondStatus($g_t$)} returns the status of the precondition for
  the given goal whether it is \textsc{satisfied, unsatisfied} or
  \textsc{unknown}. For instance, the precondition for slicing the eggs is
  whether the eggs are boiled appropriately.
  
  \item \textit{isLive($g_t$)} returns \textit{true} if all the predecessors of
  the given goal are \textsc{achieved} and all the preconditions of the goal are
  \textsc{satisfied}; otherwise returns \textit{false}.
  
%   \item \textit{isFocusShift($g_t$)} returns \textit{true} if the given
%   goal is not the previous focus (top of the stack); otherwise returns
%   \textit{false}.
  
%   \item \textit{isNecessaryFocusShift($g_t$)} returns \textit{true} if the
%   status of the previous focus was \textsc{achieved}; otherwise returns
%   \textit{false} \cite{rich:focused-unfocused-users}.
  
%   \item \textit{isPath($g_1$, $g_2$)} returns \textit{true} if there is a path
%   between $g_1$ and $g_2$ in a plan tree structure; otherwise returns
%   \textit{false}.
  
%   \item \textit{doesContribute($g_t$)} returns whether the given goal
%   contributes to another goal in the higher level of the plan hierarchy. For
%   instance, an abstract (nonprimitive) goal of ``Prepare Peanut Butter
%   Sandwich'' contributes to the higher level goal of ``Prepare Two Sandwiches''.
  
  \item \textit{extractContributingGoals($g_t$)} returns all contributing goals
  of the given goal. For instance, ``Boil Water'', ``Slice Egg'' and other goals
  in this level are multiple goals contributing to the ``Prepare Boiled Egg
  Sandwich'' nonprimitive goal.
  
  \item \textit{extractPredecessors($g_t$)} returns the predecessors of the
  given goal. For instance, the ``Spread Peanut Butter'' and ``Spread
  Strawberry Jam'' goals are the predecessors of another goal called ``Press
  Bread Slices''.
  
  \item \textit{extractInputs($g_t$)} returns all required inputs for the given
  goal. For example, the goal ``Boil Water'' requires inputs such as
  \textit{Pot} and \textit{Stove}.
  
  \item \textit{isAvailable($g_t$)} returns whether the given input is
  available. For instance, if the \textit{Pot} is required for the goal
  ``Boil Water'', is it available now?
  
%   \item \textit{isAchieved($g_t$)} returns whether the given goal is achieved,
%   i.e., whether all the postconditions of the given goal are \textsc{satisfied}.
  
  \item \textit{isFocused($g_t$)} returns whether the focus is on the given
  goal. The focused goal is the goal that the robot currently pursues.
  
  \item \textit{getResponsible($g_t$)} returns responsible agents of the given
  goal. In a dyadic collaboration, both of the agents can be partly responsible
  for a nonprimitive goal, while each is responsible for one or more primitive
  goals. For instance, both Mary and the subject are responsible for the
  nonprimitive goal ``Prepare Peanut Butter Sandwich'', whereas only Mary is
  responsible for the primitive goal ``Spread Peanut Butter''.
\end{itemize}

\vspace*{-3mm}
\section{Appraisal Processes}
\label{sec:appraisal-process}

We discuss two appraisal variables in a collaboration context, i.e.,
\textit{Relevance} (since other appraisals are only derived for relevant
events), and \textit{Controllability} (since it is associated with the agent's
coping ability). There are other appraisal variables introduced in psychological
\cite{scherer:appraisal-processes} and computational literature
\cite{gratch:domain-independent}. We have implemented other appraisal variables
such as \textit{expectedness} \cite{shayganfar:appraisal-short} and
\textit{desirability} \cite{shayganfar:emotional-awareness} which do not appear
in this paper due to space limitations. The algorithms in this section use
mental states of the robot (see Section \ref{sec:mental-states}) which are
formed based on the collaboration structure.

\subsection{Relevance}

Relevance as an appraisal variable measures the significance of an event for the
robot. An event can be evaluated to be relevant if it has a non-zero utility
\cite{marsella:ema-process-model}. Relevance is an important appraisal variable
since the other appraisal variables are more meaningful only for relevant
events. However, the utility of an event during collaboration is influenced by
the other collaborator's actions and mental states because there is a commitment
between collaborators to achieve the shared goal based on the shared plan. Other
appraisal models only consider the utlity of an event based on the self's
(robot's) goal and plan.

Algorithm \ref{alg:relevance} determines the relevance of the given event with
respect to the current mental state. The relevance of the event depends on the
significance of the event with respect to the collaboration status, which is
determined based on the utility of the event as presented in
\cite{gratch:domain-independent,marsella:ema-process-model}. We believe
computing the relevance of an event during collaboration involves other factors
which other appraisal models do not consider. For instance, the human's
perceived emotion, recurrence of a belief, or occurrence of a belief about an
unrelated goal by the human also play important roles by influencing the utility
of an event during collaboration. As a result, evaluating the relevance of the
events can cause a collaborative robot to respond effectively which can
positively impact the status of the shared goal, without dedicating all
resources to every event.

\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{(Relevance)}
	\label{alg:relevance}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\Function{IsEventRelevant}{Event $\varepsilon_t$}
% 			\Statex
			\State $\mathit{g}_{t} \gets \textit{recognizeGoal}{(\varepsilon_t)}$
% 			\Statex
			\State $\mathcal{U} \gets \Call{getEventUtility}{\mathit{g}_{t}}$ 
			\State $\tau_{t} \gets \Call{getEmotionalThreshold}{\mathit{g}_{t}}$
% 			\Statex
			\If {$(\tau_{t} \leq |\mathcal{U}|)$}
				\State \Return {{\fontsize{7}{8}\selectfont RELEVANT}}
			\Else
				\State \Return {{\fontsize{7}{8}\selectfont IRRELEVANT}}
			\EndIf
		\EndFunction
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\vspace*{-3mm}
After perceiving an event, the belief about that event represents the event in
the robot's mental state. \textit{recognizeGoal} returns the goal ($g_{t}$) to
which the current event contributes, unless it is \textit{ambiguous}; $g_{t}$
is the shared goal at time (turn) $t$ within the shared plan. We compute the
utility ($-1 \leq \mathcal{U} \leq 1$) of the event using the values of the
attributes associated with the existing beliefs, and the attributes of the
motive associated with the recognized goal. We use three belief attributes (see
Section \ref{sec:mental-states}) to compute the belief-related part of the
utility:

\vspace*{-1mm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2pt]
  \setlength\itemsep{0.2mm}
  \item \textit{Strength (T)}: The extent to which the preconditions ($\alpha$),
  postconditions ($\beta$), predecessors ($\lambda$), and contributing goals
  ($\mu$) of a goal are \textsc{satisfied} or \textsc{unsatisfied} makes beliefs
  about the goal stronger. An \textsc{unknown} pre/postcondition status of a
  goal and its predecessors and contributing goals forms weaker beliefs. For
  instance, if one knows all predecessors of a pursued goal (e.g., ``Press Bread
  Slices'') are \textsc{satisfied} (i.e., ``Spread Peanut Butter'' and ``Spread
  Strawberry Jam''), failure of the pursued goal will elicit one's negative
  emotion (due to the strong beliefs related to the goal); whereas not knowing
  the status of the goal-related factors (e.g., whether Mary could find the
  knife to cut the sandwich in half) causes one to form weaker beliefs about the
  goal.
  \item \textit{Saliency (S)}: Beliefs related to the goal at the top of the
  focus stack are more salient than beliefs related to any other goal in the
  plan. For example, according to Figure \ref{fig:taskModel}, if one is making a
  peanut butter sandwich, all of the \textit{live} (see Section
  \ref{sec:collaboration}) contributing goals to ``Prepare Peanut Butter
  Sandwich'' (e.g. Spread Peanut Butter) will be in the focus stack, and
  consequently are more salient. \textit{Non-live} goals in the shared plan
  (e.g. Slice Egg) will not be salient.
  \item \textit{Persistence (P)}: The recurrence of a belief over time (turns)
  increases the persistence of the belief. Beliefs occurring only once have the
  lowest value of persistence. For instance, if Mary keeps saying that she can
  not find the knife to cut the sandwich in half, one could pursue a new goal
  outside of the shared plan to acknowledge Mary's concern.
\end{itemize}

\noindent We also use two motive attributes discussed in Section
\ref{sec:mental-states} to compute the motive related part of the utility
($\mathcal{U}$):

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2pt]
  \setlength\itemsep{1mm}
  \item \textit{Urgency ($\gamma$)}: There are two factors impacting the urgency
  of a motive: a) whether the goal directing the given motive is the predecessor of
  another goal for which the other collaborator is responsible, and b) whether
  achieving the goal directing the given motive can mitigate the other
  collaborator's negative valenced emotion. For instance, if one has a private
  goal to prepare for making the second sandwich (e.g. get the eggs) while Mary
  is waiting to get the first sandwich and cut it in half, pressing bread slices
  and passing them to Mary will be more urgent than one's private goal.
  \item \textit{Importance ($\eta$)}: A motive is important if failure of the
  directing goal causes an impasse in the shared plan (i.e., no further goal is
  available to achieve), or achievement of the directing goal removes an
  existing impasse. For example, if one cannot find white bread on which to
  spread peanut butter (an impasse to make the peanut butter sandwich), and Mary
  offers to use wheat bread instead (external motive), the new motive becomes
  important to remove the impasse in the shared plan.
\end{itemize}

\vspace*{-4mm}
\begin{equation}
    \Psi = \frac{\alpha_{_k} + \beta_{_k} + \lambda_{_k} +
    \mu_{_k}}{\alpha_{_{all}} + \beta_{_{all}} + \lambda_{_{all}} +
    \mu_{_{all}}} + \eta + \gamma
    \label{eqn:power}
\end{equation}

\vspace*{1mm}
\begin{center} 
    $\eta, \gamma \in \mathbb{N}, \qquad\qquad \eta, \gamma \geq 0$\\
    $\alpha_{_k}, \beta_{_k}, \lambda_{_k}, \mu_{_k} \in \mathbb{N},
    \qquad\qquad \alpha_{_k}, \beta_{_k}, \lambda_{_k}, \mu_{_k} \geq 0$\\
    $\alpha_{_{all}}, \lambda_{_{all}}, \mu_{_{all}} \in \mathbb{N},
    \qquad\qquad \alpha_{_{all}}, \lambda_{_{all}}, \mu_{_{all}} \geq 0$\\
    $\beta_{_{all}} \in \mathbb{N}, \qquad\qquad \beta_{_{all}} \geq 1$
\end{center}

In equation \ref{eqn:power}, the subscript \textit{k} refers to the
\textit{known} goal-related factors (\textsc{satisfied} or
\textsc{unsatisfied}); whereas the subscript \textit{all} includes both
\textit{known} and \textit{unknown} goal-related factors. In this equation, both
urgency ($\gamma$) and importance ($\eta$) attributes of motives can impact the
outcome of the goal-related belief attributes' ratio, and ultimately the $\Psi$
value.

\vspace*{-3mm}
\begin{equation}
    U(\varepsilon_t)= 
    \begin{dcases}
       \upsilon\!P\cdot S^{\Psi} & \Psi \textgreater 0 \\
       0               			 & \Psi = 0
    \end{dcases}
    \label{eqn:utility}
\end{equation}

We compute the utility of an event based on the above five attributes. The
$\upsilon$'s value becomes +1 if the status of the corresponding goal is
\textsc{achieved}, \textsc{pending}, or \textsc{in progress}, and $\upsilon$'s
value becomes -1 if the status of the corresponding goal is \textsc{failed,
blocked, inapplicable}. Therefore, the value of the overall utility can be
positive, negative or zero.

The significance of an event in a collaborative environment is based on the
utility of the event and the perceived emotion of the human collaborator. The
human's emotion influences the relevance the event in the form of a threshold
value $\tau_{t}$ (see Algorithm \ref{alg:relevance}). For instance, a positively
expressed emotion of the human reduces the threshold value which makes the robot
find an event relevant with even a slightly positive utility. This threshold
value is currently determined based on whether the valence of the human's
perceived emotion is positive (e.g., happiness) or negative (e.g., anger).
Therefore, an event can be considered \textsc{irrelevant} even though the
utility has a relatively positive value, because relevance is influenced by the
human's perceived negative emotion.

% \subsection{Desirability}
% 
% Desirability characterizes the value of an event to the robot in terms of
% whether the event facilitates or thwarts the collaboration goal. Desirability
% captures the valence of an event with respect to the robot's preferences
% \cite{gratch:domain-independent}. In a collaborative robot, preferences are
% biased towards those events facilitating progress in the collaboration.
% Desirability plays an important role in the overall architecture; it makes the
% processes involved in the other mechanisms (e.g., Motivation and Theory of
% Mind), and consequently the robot's mental state, congruent with the
% collaboration status which is a collaborative robot's desire. Therefore, it
% causes the robot to dismiss events causing inconsistencies in the robot's
% collaborative behavior. Moreover, desirability is also crucial from the
% collaboration's point of view.
% 
% Algorithm \ref{alg:desirability} provides a process in which the desirability of
% an event is computed with regard to the status of the shared goal; i.e., it
% operates based on whether and how the event changes the status of the current
% shared goal. It distinguishes between the top level goal and the current goal
% because the top level goal's change of status attains a higher positive or
% negative value of desirability. For instance, failure of the top level goal
% (e.g., installing solar panel) is more undesirable than failure of a primitive
% goal (e.g., measuring the quality of the installed panel).
% 
% An \textsc{ambiguous} goal is a goal associated with the current event
% ($\varepsilon_t$) which is not recognized in the robot's plan; therefore it is
% \textsc{undesirable} for a collaborative robot. A top level goal' status must be
% \textsc{achieved} (i.e., \textsc{satisfied} postcondition) to consider the event
% \textsc{most-desirable}. When the goal's status is \textsc{failed} (i.e.,
% \textsc{unsatisfied} postcondition) or \textsc{blocked}, the associated event
% has the \textsc{most-undesirable} or \textsc{undesirable} values respectively.
% A goal is \textsc{blocked} if any of the required goals or goals recursively
% through the parent goal are not \textsc{achieved}. An \textsc{inapplicable} goal
% is also considered as \textsc{undesirable}. A goal is \textsc{inapplicable} if
% any of its predecessors are not \textsc{achieved}, and/or its preconditions are
% not \textsc{satisfied}. For \textsc{pending} and \textsc{inprogress} top level
% goals, the status of the current goal associated with the top level goal
% determines the status of the event $\varepsilon_t$. Only a non-primitive goal
% can have \textsc{inprogress} status, if it has been started but is not yet
% completed. A goal can be \textsc{pending} if it is live, or if it is a
% non-primitive goal that has not been started yet. \textsc{Achieved} current
% goals mark an event ($\varepsilon_t$) as \textsc{desirable}, while
% \textsc{failed} or \textsc{blocked} current goals render the event associated
% with them as \textsc{most-undesirable} and \textsc{undesirable} respectively.
% \textsc{Pending} or \textsc{inprogress} current goals mark their associated
% events as \textsc{neutral}.

% \subsection{Expectedness}
% 
% Expectedness is the extent to which the truth value of a state could have been
% predicted from causal interpretation of an event
% \cite{marsella:ema-process-model}. In the collaboration context the expectedness
% of an event evaluates the congruency of the event with respect to the existing
% knowledge about the shared goal. Thus, expectedness underlies a collaborative
% robot's attention. Congruent beliefs in a robot's mental state will lead to more
% consistent and effective outcomes of the processes in the overall architecture.
% The collaboration mechanism uses expectedness to maintain the robot's attention
% and subsequently its mental state with respect to the shared goal. Reciprocally,
% the appraisal mechanism uses the underlying information of the collaboration
% structure to evaluate the expectedness of an event. Therefore, a collaborative
% robot uses expectedness to maintain its own mental state towards the shared
% goal. The robot will also be able to respond to unexpected but relevant events.
% 
% \begin{algorithm}
% 	\caption{(Expectedness)}
% 	\label{alg:expectedness}
% 	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
% 		\Function{IsEventExpected}{Event $\varepsilon_t$}
% % 			\Statex
% 			\State $\mathit{g}_{t} \gets \textit{recognizeGoal}{(\varepsilon_t)}$
% 			\State $\mathit{g}_{top} \gets \textit{getTopLevelGoal}{(\mathit{g}_{t})}$
% % 			\Statex
% 			\If {$(\textit{isLive}{(\mathit{g}_{t})})$}
% 				\If {$(\neg \textit{isFocusShift}{(\mathit{g}_{t})}\hspace*{2mm}\OR$ \\
% 				\hspace*{13mm}$\textit{isNeccessaryFocusShift}{(\mathit{g}_{t})})$}
% 				\State \Return {\fontsize{7}{8}\selectfont MOST-EXPECTED}
% 				\Else
% 					\State \Return {\fontsize{7}{8}\selectfont EXPECTED}
% 				\EndIf
% 			\Else
% 				\If {$(\textit{isPath}{(\mathit{g}_{t}, \mathit{g}_{top})})$}
% 					\State \Return {\fontsize{7}{8}\selectfont UNEXPECTED}
% 				\Else
% 					\State \Return {\fontsize{7}{8}\selectfont MOST-UNEXPECTED}
% 				\EndIf
% 			\EndIf
% 		\EndFunction
% 	\end{algorithmic}
% \end{algorithm}
% 
% In Algorithm \ref{alg:expectedness} we provide the process of computing the
% expectedness based on the shared plan and status of the shared goal. The key
% point in this algorithm is the status of the current shared goal
% ($\mathit{g}_{t}$) that is associated with the event $\varepsilon_t$ and its
% relationship with the top level goal ($\mathit{g}_{_{top}}$).
% 
% The intuition captured here is that one expects the current goal to be finished
% before undertaking another activity, but the goals that are the next focus of
% attention are also to be expected \cite{rich:focused-unfocused-users}.
% Therefore, if the goal is live, the algorithm checks whether the goal has not
% changed, or the interpretation of the last event results in a necessary focus
% shift. Shifting the focus to a new goal is necessary when the former goal is
% achieved and a new goal is required. Consequently the new event is the
% \textsc{most-expected} one. However, even if the focus shift is not necessary,
% the new event can be considered as \textsc{expected}, since the corresponding
% goal is already live. For goals that have not yet been started (that is, are not
% live), the algorithm must determine how unexpected it would be to pursue one
% now; if the goal is at least in the plan, i.e., on the path to the top level
% goal, it is just \textsc{unexpected} while any others are
% \textsc{most-unexpected}.

\subsection{Controllability}
\label{sec:controllability}

Controllability is the extent to which an event can be influenced; it is
associated with a robot's ability to cope with an event
\cite{gratch:domain-independent}. Thus, a robot can determine whether an event's
outcome can be altered by actions under either of the collaborators' control. In
other words, controllability is a measure of a robot's ability to maintain or
change a particular state as a consequence of an event.

\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{(Controllability)}
	\label{alg:controllability}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]

 			\State $\mathit{g}_{t} \gets \textit{recognizeGoal}{(\varepsilon_t)}$

			\omega_{2}\cdot \mathcal{P} + \omega_{3}\cdot \mathcal{I}}{\omega_{0} +
			\omega_{1} + \omega_{2} + \omega_{3}} + \mathcal{V}_{e_h}$
  			\Statex
% 			\State $\tau_{t} \gets \Call{getEmotionalThreshold}{\mathit{g}_{t}}$
% 			\Statex
			\If {$(\mathcal{X} > 0)$}
				\State \Return {{\fontsize{7}{8}\selectfont CONTROLLABLE}}
			\Else
				\State \Return {{\fontsize{7}{8}\selectfont UNCONTROLLABLE}}
			\EndIf
		\EndFunction
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\vspace*{-3mm}
Controllability is important for the overall architecture. For instance, the
robot can choose to ask or negotiate about a collaborative task which is not
controllable, or form a new motive to establish an alternative goal for the
current uncontrollable event. In general, other mechanisms in the architecture
use the controllability output in their decision making processes; meanwhile
controllability uses information from the collaboration structure, e.g.,
predecessors of a goal.

An important determinant of one's emotional response is the sense of control
over occurring events. This sense of subjective control is based on one's
reasoning about self's power. For instance, the robustness of one's plan for
executing actions can increase one's sense of power and subsequently the sense
of control. In the collaboration context, we have translated the sense of control
into a combination of four different factors including a) \textit{agency} and b)
\textit{autonomy} of the robot, as well as the ratios of c) \textit{successful
predecessors}, and d) the \textit{available inputs} of a given goal
(i.e., $\mathit{g}_{t}$) in the shared plan.

In Algorithm \ref{alg:controllability}, we partially compute the controllability
of an event based on the above four factors (lines 3 to 6). We use weighted
averaging of these factors to determine their impact on the controllability of
an event. The value of all these weights are set to \textit{1.0} for the purpose
of simplicity at this stage. We will adjust these weights after further
investigating the influence of these factors, and implementing other mechanisms
in the overall architecture. We believe that the human's perceived emotion also
impacts the controllability of an event ($\mathcal{V}_{e_h}$ in line 9). The
($-1.0 \leq \mathcal{V}_{e_h} \leq 1.0$) is the valence value of the human's
perceived emotion. Positive emotions, e.g., happiness, possess positive values,
and negative emotions, e.g., anger, have negative values. The magnitude of this
value can change with respect to the intensity of the perceived emotion. Thus, a
positive controllability value indicates that an event is \textsc{controllable};
otherwise \textsc{uncontrollable}.

\textit{\textbf{Agency}} is the capacity of an individual to act independently
in a given environment. In a collaborative environment collaborators are
sometimes required to act independently of each other. Hence, they need to have
some internal motives that are formed based on their own mental states rather
than motives that are reinforced by the other. These internal motives will lead
the collaborators to acquire new intentions when required. If the robot's mental
state possesses only an internal motive supporting the recognized goal, we
consider a maximum agency value denoted as $\mathcal{M}$ in Algorithm
\ref{alg:controllability} (i.e., $\mathcal{M}=1.0$); otherwise we consider the
minimum agency value (i.e., $\mathcal{M}=0.0$). Note that the process of forming
new internal motives is beyond scope of this paper.

\textit{\textbf{Autonomy}} is the ability to make decisions without the
influence of others, and implies acting on one's own and being responsible for
that. In a collaborative environment, tasks are delegated to the collaborators
based on their capabilities. Therefore, each collaborator is responsible for
the delegated task and the corresponding goal. In Algorithm
\ref{alg:controllability}, $\mathcal{R}$ denotes the value of autonomy with
regard to the goal $\mathit{g}_{t}$. This value $(0.0 \leq \mathcal{R} \leq
1.0)$ is the ratio of the number of goals contributing to $\mathit{g}_{t}$
for which the robot is responsible over the total number of contributing goals,
if the goal associated with the current event is a nonprimitive goal. However,
if the associated goal of the current event corresponds to a primitive goal the
value of $\mathcal{M}$ would be 0.0 or 1.0. In general, higher autonomy leads to
a more positive value of controllability.

The structure of a shared plan contains the order of the required
\textit{\textbf{predecessors}} of a goal. Predecessors of a goal, $g_t$, are
goals that the collaborators should achieve before trying to achieve goal $g_t$.
We use the ratio of successfully achieved predecessors of the recognized goal
over the total number of predecessors of the same goal. If all of the
predecessors of the given goal are achieved, then $\mathcal{P}=1.0$ which is the
maximum value for $\mathcal{P}$. On the contrary, failure of all of the
predecessors will lead to $\mathcal{P}=0.0$. Therefore, a higher $\mathcal{P}$
value positively impacts the value of controllability for the current event.

Finally, \textit{\textbf{inputs}} of a task are the required elements that the
collaborators use to achieve the specified goal of the task. These inputs are
also part of the structure of a shared plan. We compute the ratio of the
available required inputs over the total required inputs of the goal associated
with the current event. This value (denoted as $\mathcal{I}$ in Algorithm
\ref{alg:controllability}) will be bound between 0.0 and 1.0. Similar to the
other factors in the controllability process, the closer the value of
$\mathcal{I}$ gets to 1.0, the more positive impact it has on the overall
controllability value of the event.

In summary, the output of these two and other appraisal processes such as
\textit{desirability} \cite{shayganfar:emotional-awareness} and
\textit{expectedness} \cite{shayganfar:appraisal-short} serves as critical input
for the other mechanisms and processes (e.g., goal management
\cite{shayganfar:goal-management}) of the Affective Motivational Collaboration
Framework, shown in Figure \ref{fig:cpm}. By providing adequate interpretation
of events in the collaborative environment, the appraisal mechanism enables the
robot to carry out proper collaborative behaviors.

\section{Evaluation and Discussion}
\label{sec:user-study}

We developed our user study to test our hypothesis that humans will provide
similar answers as our algorithms to questions related to different factors used
to compute two appraisal variables. We conducted a between subject user study
using an online crowdsourcing website --
CrowdFlower\footnote{http://www.crowdflower.com}. We had one group of
subjects for each questionnaire corresponding to each appraisal variable.
There were 12 questions (including 2 test questions) in the controllability, and
22 questions (including 3 test questions) in the relevance questionnaire. Each
group originally had 40 subjects. To increase the quality of our subjects'
answers, we limited the visibility of our questionnaires to a few English
speaking countries, i.e., United States, Britain, and Australia. We also limited
our subject pools to those that have acquired the highest confidence level on
the crowdsourcing website. Our questionnaires included 2 or 3 test questions
(depending on the length) to check the sanity of the answers. We eliminated
subjects providing wrong answers to our sanity questions. We also eliminated
subjects with an answering time less than 2 minutes. The number of accepted
subjects in each group is provided in Table \ref{tbl:statistics}.

To minimize the background knowledge necessary for our test subjects, we used a
simple example of preparing a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and a hard
boiled egg sandwich for a hiking trip. We provided clear textual and graphical
instructions for both questionnaires. The instructions presented a sequence of
hypothetical collaborative tasks to be carried out by the test subject and an
imaginary friend, Mary, in order to accomplish their goal of preparing two
sandwiches. Figure \ref{fig:taskModel} shows the corresponding task model for
these instructions. Test questions introduced specific situations related to the
shared plan; these situations included, among others, blocked tasks, and failure
or achievement of a shared goal provided in the instruction. Each question
provided three possible answers (which were counterbalanced in the
questionnaire). One option provided a distinct alternative; another option was
used to provide a dichotomy with the first alternative, and a third option was
used to check whether the subjects perceived the other two options as equal.
We also provided a brief description as well as a simple example for each
appraisal variable, e.g., \textit{relevance}, at the end of the corresponding
instructions. Note that the collaboration structure and the instructions were
the same for both questionnaires.

Each question was designed based on different factors that we use in our
algorithms (see Section \ref{sec:appraisal-process}). Here, we present one
example question from the relevance questionnaire, and describe how this
question relates to a specific factor within the corresponding algorithm. The
input for our algorithms was the task model depicted in Figure
\ref{fig:taskModel}.

  \caption{{\fontsize{9}{9}\selectfont Example Relevance Question.}}
  \label{fig:qs1}
  \vspace{-4mm}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:qs1} shows an example question from the relevance
questionnaire. In this example, with respect to Algorithm \ref{alg:relevance}
(line 6), option A is relevant because {\color{red}the task related to this
option provides the next available task in the focus stack (see the task model in
Figure \ref{fig:taskModel}). Although the task in option B is part of the
existing task model, it is considered as irrelevant by our algorithm, since it
is not live in the plan.} We provided option C to determine whether the human
subjects will similarly differentiate between these two options. This question
was presented to the human subjects to determine whether their decision for the
relevance of this event is similar to the output of the relevance algorithm. For
this question, the human decision was about 83\% similar to the algorithm's
output. Average results for both questionnaires are presented in Table
\ref{tbl:statistics}.

%   \label{fig:qs2}
%   \vspace{-2mm}
% \end{figure}
% 
% Figure \ref{fig:qs2} shows an example question from the controllability
% questionnaire. The algorithm's output is option B, and is determined by
% Algorithm \ref{alg:controllability} (line 3), similarly to the expectedness
% example above. In this example, option B is more controllable than option A,
% because the self over total ratio of the responsibility of the predecessors of
% the given task (see \textit{Autonomy} in Section \ref{sec:controllability}) is
% higher than the ratio in option A; i.e., self is responsible to spread peanut
% butter on one slice of bread and strawberry jam on another slice of bread. In
% this question, the humans decision was 90\% in agreement with the algorithm's
% output.

% \begin{figure}[tbh]

%   \vspace*{-7mm}
%   \caption{{\fontsize{9}{9}\selectfont Example Desirability Question.}}
%   \label{fig:qs3}
%   \vspace{-2mm}
% \end{figure}
% 
% Figure \ref{fig:qs3} shows an example question from the desirability
% questionnaire. The output based on the Algorithm \ref{alg:desirability}
% (line 14) is option C, since in both option A and option B, the focus goal
% has been achieved successfully. Therefore, in this example, both options A and B
% are desirable. The humans decision was 77\% in agreement with the algorithm's
% output in this question.

We conducted the user study to compare the results with the implemented
algorithms discussed in Section \ref{sec:appraisal-process}. As we mentioned,
each question had 3 answers. Therefore, a totally random distribution would
result in 33\% agreement with our algorithms' results. However, the average
agreement ratio is significantly higher than 33\%. The total number of subjects'
answers similar to a) the \textit{relevance} algorithm (n=29) averaged 71.3\%
(s=10.7\%), b) the \textit{controllability} algorithm (n=33) averaged 74.3\%
(s=15.8\%). It is worth noting that the human subjects agreed 100\% on some
questions, while one some other questions there was a much lower level of
agreement.

The results indicate that our algorithms provide appraisal variable outputs
sufficiently similar to the decisions of human's appraisal. Our hypothesis in
our evaluation was that our algorithms would correctly predict the judgments of
humans doing these tasks. Our results indicate that people largely performed
as our hypothesis predicted. The \textit{p}-values obtained based on a
one-tailed z-test (see Table \ref{tbl:statistics}) show the probability of human
subjects' data being generated from a random set. The very small
\textit{p}-values indicate that the data set is not random; in fact, the high
percentage of similarity shows that the two appraisal algorithms predicted the
human judgments.

\vspace{-2mm}
\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-1mm}
While these results support our hypothesis, they are not a perfect prediction.
We believe the difference between these two results could be due to several
reasons, including: a) the fact that we conducted our study online and had
little control on our subjects, b) our algorithms may require further
granularity, or c) the difference between decision making processes of
individuals, which can be affected by other factors such as personality, gender,
and culture. While it may be possible to achieve a higher level of agreement
between humans and the algorithms results, these results indicate that the
current algorithms are adequate to be used in a collaboration context. In our
future work, we will implement the remaining mechanisms in Affective
Motivational Collaboration framework and carry out an end-to-end user study to
verify the behavior of a collaborative robot using our architecture.
